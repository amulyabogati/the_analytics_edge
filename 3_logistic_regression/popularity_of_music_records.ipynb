    "What conclusions can you make about our model? *Select all that apply*.\r\n",
    "- Model 3 favors specificity over sensitivity.\r\n",
    "- Model 3 provides conservative predictions, and predicts that a song will make it to the Top 10 very rarely. So while it detects less than half of the Top 10 songs, we can be very confident in the songs that it does predict to be Top 10 hits."
